/**
 * Use the type `addr_t` for variables holding addresses.
 *
 * We define addr_t as just another name for `int`. `int` is an overkill
 * (addresses are supposed to be 8-bit), but C++ finds arithmetic operations on
 * 8-bit data suspicious, so making it an int will silence the warnings.
 *
 * Could have also used plain `int` for addresses, with no effect on
 * functionality, but it's considered better practice to use names that match
 * what the type represents, regardless of how that type is interpreted by the
 * compiler.
 *
 * Beyond the lectures:
 *
 * An even better practice would be to create a new custom **struct** `addr_t`
 * that encapsulates the actual value.
 *
 * typedef'ed types are syntactically interchangable, i.e., we can pass an
 * `int` to a function expecting a typedef'ed `addr_t`, becayse `addr_t` is just
 * another name for `int`.
 *
 * If `addr_t` was a struct containing an `int`, calling the function with an
 * `int` would be a compile-time error. Passing a plain `int` to a function
 * expecting an address is likely to be an error, so capturing this error at
 * compile-time is good!

/**
 * An interface for all the different kinds of instructions.
 *
 * All instruction classes inherit directly or indirectly from this abstract
 * class. This allows us to abstract many of the peculiarities of each
 * instruction type behind the two virtual calls of this base class:
 * _execute() and name().
 *
 * Beyond the lectures:
 *
 * There are more elegant and concise ways for building a class hierarchy of
 * instructions. Unfortunately, they involve heavy use of templates and/or
 * multiple inheritance. Ask me what this means in the lab. A verbose, but
 * easy to understand implementation is better in the context of this
 * assignment.
 *
 * If you feel like having fun, try to make the implementation of this class
 * hierarchy more concise. Ideally, make these changes separately from your
 * submission, since it's likely that making this code concise will break the
 * tests. Send me your attempt by email. I will give you feedback and, if
 * you've done something clever, you will get an extra mark.
 *
 * Is this extra mark worth the time and mental anguish? No, not really.
 * ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 * So, do this only if you actually want to have "fun" and you have the
 * necessary bandwidth.
