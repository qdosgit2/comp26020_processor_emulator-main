//
// The classes in this file implement an emulator for an unrealistically simple
// processor architecture. While the general code organisation matches how real
// simulators are structured, the actual operations are, deliberately, much
// simpler. 
//
// To make this implementation slightly more interesting, the processor supports
// step execution and breakpoints.
//
// Separating the decode and execute stages and transfering dynamically created
// instruction objects between them is an overkill in this simple design. But
// this is exactly how it's done in real simulators where the flow of
// instructions through the processor can be much more complicated
// (e.g., out-of-order execution)
