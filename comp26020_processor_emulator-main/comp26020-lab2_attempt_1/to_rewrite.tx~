The implementation is composed of five files:

• instructions.cpp and instructions.h contain a class hierarchy of processor instructions,
including how they are created, how they are represented as strings, and, most importantly, how
executing them modifies the processor state.

• emulator.cpp and emulator.h describe the emulator itself: how the processor state is initialiased or
loaded from a file, how instructions are executed, how breakpoints are managed.

• common.h contains header information that is needed by both the emulator and the instructions.
